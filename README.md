# Personal Profile Page

**This class assignment consists of two experiments:**

- Experiment 1 – Creating a profile page using HTML.
- Experiment 2 – Enhancing the profile page with CSS or creating a blog post.

This repository contains the source code for this single-page personal profile website. Created as a class assignment, this project serves as a digital introduction, showcasing personal information, interests, and social links with a clean, modern aesthetic.

## Features

*   **Minimalist Design:** A clean and modern layout with a two-tone color palette (`#fff7f0` and `#262523`).
*   **Dynamic Header:** A unique header that creatively spells out the name "halfpace" - the username to most of my other social presence.
*   **About Me Section:** Features a circular profile picture, a concise biography, and a list of hobbies and skills.
*   **Social Links:** An organized section with clickable links to GitHub, Discord, and email.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Engaging CSS hover animations on titles and links to enhance user experience.
*   **Custom Typography:** Utilizes "Anton" and "Oswald" from Google Fonts for distinct and readable text.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the webpage.
*   **CSS3:** For all styling, including Flexbox for layout and keyframe animations for interactive effects.
